pyconfr-2014-asyncio-presentation
=================================

This repository hosts my presentation at PyconFR 2014 about the Python 3.4 asyncio standard library.

At PyconFR 2014, two asyncio presentations were planned. Since these two presentations complement each other, the links are reported below for documentation purpose:

* "Asyncio: offrez des Tulipes à vos entrées-sorties asynchrones" by Thierry Chappuis (in french) 
* "Exploration de la boucle d'événements asyncio" by Victor Stinner (in french) http://goo.gl/AR6L7h
